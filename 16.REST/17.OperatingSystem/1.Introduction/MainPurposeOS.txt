1.Interface b/w User and Hardware(CPU , I/O devices , RAM)
2.Resource Management: basically kon sa harware kisko allocate krna hai and vapas lena hai so NO interference 
b/w each other

3.Process Management : The OS oversees the execution of multiple processes or tasks simultaneously. Itschedules processes, switches between them, and provides a fair share of the CPU time to each process,enabling multitasking and ensuring responsiveness. (basically deal with Parallel Processes)

4.Storage Management(storing Permanent data on hard disk) - basically does it using File System
File Management: The operating system provides a hierarchical structure for organizing files and directorieson storage devices. 

5.Implement memory management to optimize RAM usage (because RAM is limited so allocate phir delocate krnahoga taki sbko RAM mil ske)

6.Privacy - 1.provide authentication(verified user hi login kr pata h windows me)
                2.provide sequrity b/w process also if (p1 Interfare in p2 ) p1 will be blocked
    

### Throughput - number of tasks executed per unit time
