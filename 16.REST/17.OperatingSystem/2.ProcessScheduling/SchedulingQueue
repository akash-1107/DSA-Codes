There are different types of scheduling queues, each serving a specific purpose in process/thread management. Some common types of scheduling queues include:

1.Ready Queue: This queue holds all the processes/threads that are ready to be executed by the CPU. Processes/threads in this queue are in a state where they are waiting for their turn to run, but they are not currently running. The CPU scheduler selects processes/threads from this queue for execution based on the scheduling algorithm in use.

2.Running Queue: This queue contains the process/thread that is currently being executed by the CPU. As the CPU can only execute one process/thread at a time, this queue typically holds just one item.

3.Waiting Queue: Processes/threads that are waiting for a specific event to occur, such as the completion of an I/O operation, are placed in the waiting queue. Once the event occurs, the processes/threads are moved back to the ready queue to be considered for execution.

4.Blocked Queue: Similar to the waiting queue, the blocked queue holds processes/threads that are waiting for a specific event. However, processes/threads in the blocked queue cannot be considered for execution until the event they are waiting for is signaled by some external factor.

    
Schedulers use these queues to determine which process/thread to execute next based on scheduling algorithms like First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS), Round-Robin, Priority Scheduling, etc. The scheduler periodically selects a process/thread from the ready queue and moves it to the running queue, allowing it to use the CPU's execution time. Once the process/thread's time slice is over (in the case of preemptive scheduling algorithms), it is moved back to the ready queue to await its next turn.
