#NON-PREEMPTIVE-
1.FCFS (non-Preemptive) [First Come First Serve] -
Based on Arrival Time

2.SJF (Shortest Job Next)(non-preemptive)
SJF is a non-preemptive scheduling algorithm that selects the process with the shortest burst time next.

#PRE-EMPTIVE-
3.LRTF (Longest Remaining Time First): (pre)
LRTF is a preemptive version of SJF, where the process with the longest remaining burst time is selected to execute. If a new process arrives with a longer burst time, the currently running process is preempted.

4.SRTF (Longest Remaining Time First): (pre)
SRTF is a preemptive version of SJF, where the process with the Shortestest remaining burst time is selected to execute. If a new process arrives with a SHORTER burst time, the currently running process is preempted.

5.Round Robin is a preemptive scheduling algorithm where each process gets a fixed time slice or quantum to execute. If a process does not complete within the time slice, it is moved back to the ready queue, and the next process is selected.
(isme ready queue and running queue maintain krke chalenge)
(Hm pehle jo process aa rha usko ready queue me push phir check ki running wale ko hatana h yaa nhi agr haa toh sara aane wala ke baad push in ready queue)

6.Priority Scheduling (both possible)
Priority Scheduling assigns a priority value to each process, and the process with the highest priority is selected for execution. In the preemptive version, the running process can be preempted if a higher-priority process arrives. In the non-preemptive version, the running process continues until it completes.
