Ageing (Context of Scheduling):
. Technique to prevent starvation and ensure fairness among processes.
. Increases the priority of long-waiting processes gradually.
. Helps prioritize waiting processes and prevents indefinite starvation.

Starvation (Context of Scheduling):
. Occurs when a process is unable to execute due to resource unavailability.
. Can happen when higher-priority processes continuously monopolize resources.***
. Can lead to poor system performance and unfair resource distribution.

Deadlock (Context of Scheduling):
. A state where multiple processes are stuck in a cyclic dependency for resources.
. Each process is waiting for a resource held by another process in the deadlock group.
. Can cause a system freeze, and deadlock detection and prevention mechanisms are used to address it.
